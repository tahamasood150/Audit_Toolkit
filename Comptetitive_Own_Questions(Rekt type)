Do you have all actors, roles, and privileges documented?
Do you keep documentation of all the external services, contracts, and oracles you rely on?
The best ways to attack your system?
Define key invariants for the system?
The best automated tools to discover security issues in your code?
Usage of Oracle?
Governance ?
Multi-Chain ?
Signatures used ?
What Token Standards Used ?
Total Lines of SLOC ?
Complexity of Code ?
How many Public and External Functions?
What external libraries are used? (like: ChainLink , Openzeppelin)
Run the code through a spellchecker ?
Avoid using assembly as much as possible? (Use of assembly increases audit times because it throws away Solidity's guardrails and must be checked much more carefully)
Document use of unchecked. (Concretely describe why it is safe to not perform arithmetic checks on each code block. Preferably for each operation.)
Any public function that can be made external should be made external.( This is not just a gas consideration, but it also reduces the cognitive overhead for auditors because it reduces the number of possible contexts in which the function can be called.)
